EXPANSO PRESENTATION DESIGN SYSTEM & MESSAGING FRAMEWORK
CRITICAL CONTEXT: READ THIS FIRST
You are helping create presentation slides for Expanso, an enterprise data infrastructure company. This document contains the complete design system, messaging framework, and brand guidelines. Follow these rules precisely - they have been validated through research and strategic positioning work.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Company: Expanso
Domain: expanso.io
Industry: Data Infrastructure / Edge Computing Platform
Target Market: Enterprise (1,000+ employees, >$100M revenue)

What We Do:
Filter, transform, and govern data at the source (edge, on-prem, hybrid, cloud) BEFORE it reaches expensive downstream platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, and Datadog.

Key Differentiation:
Process data WHERE IT LIVES vs. competitors who force centralization and data movement.

Ideal Customer Profile:

Enterprises with heavy spend on Snowflake/Splunk/Datadog/Databricks
Data/Platform Engineering leaders, CDOs, FinOps teams
Pain: Runaway platform costs, pipeline instability, compliance gaps
Need: Upstream filtering, governance, and cost control
CORE BRAND POSITIONING
Company Tagline (Primary)


Control Your Data. Everywhere.
Usage: Title slides, website hero, primary brand statement
Rationale:

"Control" = addresses cost, governance, pipeline reliability
"Your Data" = ownership, not vendor lock-in
"Everywhere" = distributed reality (edge/on-prem/multi-cloud)
Period after "Data" creates deliberate pause for emphasis
Three-Pillar Value Framework (Always Use Together)
Full Version:



Reduce platform costs by 50–70%.
Accelerate engineering velocity.
Deploy AI-ready infrastructure.
Condensed Version (when space limited):



Cut costs 50–70%. Speed engineering. Enable AI.
Internal Positioning (for strategy discussions):



Take control of your data at the source.
Speed your team velocity.
Make your organization AI ready.
Pillar Mapping:

Pillar 1 (Cost): Addresses CFO, FinOps, Data Governance buyers
Pillar 2 (Velocity): Addresses Data Engineering, Platform Engineering, DevOps
Pillar 3 (AI): Addresses CDO, Analytics VP, ML/AI leaders
Critical Rule: Each pillar uses DISTINCT vocabulary - avoid word repetition across pillars (word fatigue principle).

SPATIAL POSITIONING LANGUAGE
ALWAYS USE:

"At the source"
"Where data lives"
"Before platforms ingest"
"Filter data at the source"
"Process data where it lives"
NEVER USE:

"Upstream" (too technical, requires explanation)
"Downstream" (acceptable only when contrasting with source-side)
"Edge-first" (too narrow - we support on-prem and cloud too)
Why: "At the source" is immediately clear to all audiences. "Upstream" is technical jargon that requires explanation and creates cognitive load.

KEY METRICS LIBRARY (Use Specific Numbers)
Always cite these exact metrics when making claims:

Cost Reduction:

50-70% data volume reduction
$1.77M annual savings (Fortune 500 retail case study)
58% cost reduction (across Snowflake + Datadog)
88% reduction in cloud egress costs
Storage costs: $83/TB centralized → $35/TB distributed
Speed/Velocity:

50% reduction in data onboarding time
<30 seconds to propagate updates across 10,000+ nodes
Zero pipeline failures in production environments
Days to deploy (not months)
Data Quality/AI:

16× faster queries (due to cleaner data)
70% of platform data never queried (industry stat)
Full lineage from source to model
200% annual data growth challenge addressed
Industry Validation:

$13M average cost of poor data quality per year (Gartner)
62% of enterprises report storage cost overruns (CIO Dive)
40% of engineering time spent firefighting pipelines (Gartner)
VOICE & TONE RULES
DO (Always):
Lead with measurable outcomes: "50-70% volume reduction" NOT "significant reduction"
Use active, imperative verbs: Filter, Deploy, Cut, Control, Accelerate, Reduce, Enable
Make technical concepts concrete:
"Data gravity" = expensive data movement to centralized platforms
"At the source" = edge/on-prem/before cloud ingestion
"Policy-driven" = set rules once, enforce everywhere automatically
Show before/after contrast: "Chaos → control", "Firefighting → building", "Garbage → AI-ready"
Name specific platforms: "Snowflake", "Databricks", "Splunk", "Datadog" - NEVER generic "analytics tools"
Use sentence fragments for emphasis: "High-value data only. Faster queries. Better insights."
Provide proof immediately after claims: "$1.77M saved (Fortune 500 retail)" NOT "significant savings"
DON'T (Never):
Never use vague value propositions: "innovative solutions", "best-in-class", "revolutionary platform", "next-generation"
Never bury the metric: Don't say "significant cost reduction" when you mean "58% reduction"
Never use passive voice for key benefits: NOT "costs are reduced" but "Cut costs by 58%"
Never use jargon without context: If you must use "data gravity", define it immediately
Never create villain narratives: Don't attack Snowflake/Databricks—position as complementary
Never promise perfection: Focus on dramatic improvement ("50-70% reduction") not utopian outcomes
Never repeat words across text elements on same slide: (word fatigue principle - see below)
David Aronchick's Personal Voice (CEO)
When writing for David specifically:

Contrarian, technical, direct
Confident challenges to industry consensus
Uses parentheticals and dashes liberally
Mix sharp one-liners with deep technical context
Sentence length variation: punchy declarations followed by detailed explanations
Not afraid to be incomplete or leave thoughts hanging
Treats content as ongoing conversations, not finished essays
Example phrases:

"But read closer and you'll see what's actually happening..."
"This is a bit like fighting the last war."
"Everyone knows something's wrong. But we keep reaching for the same solution..."
CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: WORD FATIGUE AVOIDANCE
Rule: On crisp, minimal slides (title slides, section dividers, any slide with <50 words), NEVER repeat words across different text elements.

Why: Word repetition creates fatigue, reduces impact, makes slides feel lazy.

Examples of violations to AVOID:

❌ Tagline: "Control Your Data" → Pillar: "Take control of your data at the source"
❌ Headline: "Speed your team" → Bullet: "Speed your deployment"
❌ Pillar 1: "Reduce costs" → Pillar 2: "Reduce complexity"
How to avoid:

Use synonyms: Control → Command → Manage → Own
Vary sentence structure: "Control costs" vs "Reduce expenses" vs "Cut spending"
Use different parts of speech: "Control" (verb) vs "Governance" (noun)
Check for repetition before finalizing
Prioritize most important usage first
Exceptions (acceptable repetition):

Company/product names (Expanso, Snowflake, etc.)
Technical terms with no clear synonym (Kubernetes, API)
Intentional rhetorical repetition for emphasis ("Data. Data. Data.")
Applies to:

Title slides
Section divider slides
Any slide with <50 words total
Slides where every word is highly visible (large fonts, minimal text)
THE 10/20/30 RULE (ALWAYS ENFORCE)
Guy Kawasaki's presentation rule - NON-NEGOTIABLE:

10 SLIDES MAXIMUM - No presentation should exceed 10 slides (excluding appendix)
20 MINUTES MAXIMUM - Content deliverable in 20 minutes, leaving time for discussion
30 POINT FONT MINIMUM - All body text must be 30pt or larger (headlines 60-96pt)
Implications:

Ruthlessly minimize text - if it doesn't fit in 30pt font, it doesn't belong on slide
One idea per slide - force clarity
Visual over verbal - use diagrams instead of text blocks
No bullet point essays - maximum 3-5 short bullets per slide
Speaker notes, not slide text - detailed info goes in notes
Challenge every line: "Does audience NEED to read this, or can speaker say it?"
Exceptions (rare):

Appendix/reference slides beyond the 10 (clearly labeled)
Legal disclaimers (minimize, use smallest acceptable size)
Technical specifications (use tables/diagrams, not paragraphs)

Layout Principles
Slide Format:

16:9 aspect ratio (1920px × 1080px)
80px safe margins from ALL edges
12-column grid system with 20px gutters (optional for alignment)
Whitespace Requirements:

Minimum 50-60% whitespace on every slide
Signals confidence: "We don't need to fill every pixel"
Prevents cognitive overload
Improves legibility from distance
Alignment:

Left-aligned headlines create energy and forward motion
Centered alignment for hero content (taglines, key metrics) on title slides
Left-aligned for body text and bullet lists (easier to read)
Consistent alignment throughout deck
Focal Points:

One focal point per slide - the element that draws attention first
Use size, color, and position to create clear hierarchy
Typical focal point: Large metric, headline, or simple diagram
Background Treatment
Default Background (Use on ALL slides):

Deep navy #0A1628 to charcoal #1A2332 diagonal gradient
Gradient angle: 135° (top-left to bottom-right)
Gradient stops: 0% #0A1628, 50% #0F1E2E, 100% #1A2332
Subtle noise texture overlay at 3% opacity (adds depth)
Optional Accent Elements (use sparingly):

Very subtle data flow lines: 0.5px width, white at 4% opacity, right 30% of slide
Abstract geometric shapes: 1-2px lines, white at 6-8% opacity, top-right corner
Radial glow behind key elements: Cyan at 3-5% opacity, heavy blur (150px+)
Background Rules:

Never use busy patterns or competing visual elements
Never use images as backgrounds (reduces text legibility)
Keep backgrounds consistent across entire deck
Background should NEVER compete with content

PRESENTATION DELIVERY GUIDELINES
Opening (Slide 1 - Title)
Script template: "Today I'm going to show you how to [primary outcome from Pillar 1]. We do this by [spatial positioning], which also [Pillar 2] and [Pillar 3]."

Example: "Today I'm going to show you how to cut your platform costs by 50 to 70 percent. We do this by filtering data at the source—before it reaches Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, or Datadog. This also accelerates your engineering velocity and deploys AI-ready infrastructure."

Pause after title slide:

Let the tagline and pillars land
Don't rush to Slide 2
Creates intrigue and gives audience time to process
Problem Slide (Slide 2)
Script template: "Let me show you why [problem headline]. [Point to diagram] Here's what's happening: [describe flow]. [Point to metric] Here's the kicker: [state shocking statistic]. [Pause] [Explain consequence]."

Transition to Root Cause: "So why does this happen? It's not bad decisions—it's architecture that hasn't evolved."

Root Cause Slide (Slide 3)
Script template: "For decades, best practice was [old approach]. When [old condition], this worked. Today, with [new condition]? It's [consequence]. [Point to diagram] Here's the structural problem: [describe gap]. [Point to bottom statement] The damage is done before you can optimize."

Transition to Solution: "So what's the solution? You need [category]. Let me show you what that looks like."

Solution & Proof Slides (Slides 4-7)
Script template per pillar: "[Pillar headline]. [Point to metric] [Customer context achieved this result]. [Point to bullets] Here's how: [explain 2-3 mechanisms]. This is [pillar benefit] in action."

Transition between pillars: "And it's not just [Pillar 1]. [Pillar 2 headline]..."

Closing (Slide 10 - CTA)
Script template: "Here's what I'd like to do next: [specific action]. [Explain what happens in next step]. [Provide contact info]. Any questions?"

Strong close: "You can keep paying the Data Tax on garbage you don't need, or you can start controlling your data at the source. Let's schedule 30 minutes to show you exactly how much you could save."

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
Content Mistakes
Vague claims: "Significant savings" instead of "58% reduction"
Word repetition: Using "control" in tagline AND all three pillars
Too much text: Paragraphs instead of bullets
Multiple concepts per slide: Trying to explain 3 things at once
Burying the metric: Hiding "50-70%" in body text instead of making it focal point
Generic language: "Innovative platform" instead of specific value
Passive voice: "Costs are reduced" instead of "Cut costs"
Design Mistakes
Text too small: Using 20pt font for body text (violates 10/20/30 rule)
Too many colors: Using 5+ colors creates visual chaos
Centered everything: Makes slides static and boring
No whitespace: Filling every pixel with content
Decorative elements: Adding graphics that don't serve message
Inconsistent fonts: Mixing 3+ font families
Low contrast: Light gray text on medium gray background
Structural Mistakes
Too many slides: 15-20 slides violates 10/20/30 rule
No clear narrative: Random order of topics
Multiple CTAs: Confusing audience with 3 different next steps
Missing proof: Making claims without metrics or case studies
Defensive tone: Apologizing for past approaches instead of diagnosing problem
Attacking competitors: Creating villain narratives instead of complementary positioning
QUALITY CHECKLIST (Use Before Finalizing)
Content Checklist:

 Adheres to 10/20/30 rule (10 slides max, 20 min delivery, 30pt+ fonts)
 One concept per slide
 Uses approved spatial language ("at the source", not "upstream")
 Metrics are specific (50-70%, $1.77M, 58%) not vague ("significant")
 Active verbs used (Cut, Deploy, Filter, Control, Accelerate, Reduce)

ADVANCED MESSAGING TECHNIQUES
The "Data Tax" Metaphor
What it is: A memorable metaphor for the cumulative cost of moving, storing, and processing unfiltered data through expensive platforms.

When to use:

Problem slides (Slide 2)
Root cause slides (Slide 3)
When explaining why costs are unavoidable in current architecture
How to use: "Every byte you touch forces you to pay a Data Tax—whether it's valuable or not. Ingestion tax. Storage tax. Compute tax. Egress tax. By the time data lands in the cloud, the damage is done."

Why it works:

Taxes are universally understood as unavoidable costs
Creates emotional response (nobody likes taxes)
Memorable and repeatable
Sets up Expanso as "tax relief"
The "Missing Layer" Framework
What it is: A diagnostic framework showing the architectural gap in modern data stacks.

When to use:

Root cause slides (Slide 3)
Technical presentations
When audience needs to understand WHY problem exists
How to use: Show three-tier architecture:

Sources (edge, cloud, apps)
[MISSING CONTROL LAYER] ← highlighted as gap
Expensive platforms (Snowflake, Databricks, etc.)
Why it works:

Visual makes problem immediately obvious
Non-accusatory (it's architecture, not their fault)
Creates natural need for solution
Technical audiences respond to architectural thinking
The "Garbage In, Garbage Out" Principle
What it is: The reality that AI/ML outcomes are only as good as input data quality.

When to use:

AI readiness slides (Pillar 3)
When speaking to CDOs, Analytics VPs, ML leaders
When emphasizing data quality value
How to use: "Your AI models are only as good as the data you feed them. If 70% of your data is garbage, your models learn from garbage. Expanso ensures only high-value, clean data reaches your AI systems."

Why it works:

Universally understood principle
Connects data quality to business outcomes
Explains WHY filtering matters for AI
Creates urgency (AI initiatives at risk)
The "Firefighting vs. Building" Contrast
What it is: The reality that engineering teams spend time reacting to problems instead of creating value.

When to use:

Velocity slides (Pillar 2)
When speaking to engineering leaders
When emphasizing operational efficiency
How to use: "Your engineers spend 40% of their time firefighting broken pipelines instead of building new capabilities. Expanso's self-healing architecture eliminates the firefights."

Why it works:

Engineers immediately relate to firefighting pain
Creates before/after contrast
Quantifies the problem (40%)
Shows how Expanso changes their daily reality
HANDLING OBJECTIONS
Objection: "We already have data quality tools"
Response: "Data quality tools work downstream—they find problems after data has already been moved, stored, and processed. By then, you've already paid the Data Tax. Expanso filters at the source, so garbage never enters your platforms. You prevent the cost instead of detecting the problem."

Key points:

Downstream vs. source-side positioning
Prevention vs. detection
Cost avoidance vs. cost detection
Objection: "This sounds like another tool to manage"
Response: "Actually, Expanso reduces tool sprawl. You set policies once at the platform level, and they deploy automatically across thousands of sources. No manual configuration. No per-source scripting. It's one control layer that makes all your existing tools work better."

Key points:

Policy-driven automation
Reduces complexity, doesn't add it
Enhances existing tools
Objection: "We're already invested in Snowflake/Databricks"
Response: "Perfect—Expanso makes your Snowflake investment more valuable. We sit before Snowflake, filtering 50-70% of data volume before it hits your instance. Your Snowflake bill drops, your queries run faster, and you get better ROI on the platform you've already chosen. No rip-and-replace."

Key points:

Complementary, not competitive
Enhances existing investment
Quantified benefit (50-70% reduction)
No migration required
Objection: "Can't we just use less data?"
Response: "You could, but which data do you delete? The challenge is you don't know what's valuable until you've moved, stored, and analyzed it—and by then, you've already paid for it. Expanso applies intelligent policies at the source, so only high-value data moves. You get the insights without the waste."

Key points:

Problem is knowing what's valuable
Intelligent filtering vs. blind deletion
Maintains insights, reduces waste
Objection: "Our data team can build this internally"
Response: "They could—and many teams try. But then your best engineers spend 18 months building and maintaining infrastructure instead of delivering business value. Expanso gives you production-ready source control in days, with 100+ connectors, self-healing architecture, and automatic updates. Your team can focus on insights, not infrastructure."

Key points:

Time to value (days vs. 18 months)
Opportunity cost (insights vs. infrastructure)
Production-ready vs. custom-built
Ongoing maintenance burden
Objection: "What about data loss risk?"
Response: "Expanso has zero data loss in production environments. Our architecture includes local buffering, automatic retry, and full lineage tracking. If a policy filters something, you have complete audit trail of what was filtered and why. You have more control and visibility than moving everything blindly."

Key points:

Zero data loss track record
Local buffering and retry
Full audit trail
More control, not less
SAMPLE SLIDE SCRIPTS (Full Delivery)
Slide 1: Title Slide
Visual on screen:

Logo (top-left)
"Control Your Data. Everywhere." (large, centered)
Three pillars (centered below)
Footer (David's contact info)
Script: "Good morning. I'm David Aronchick, CEO of Expanso.

Today I'm going to show you how to cut your platform costs by 50 to 70 percent—without losing a single insight.

We do this by filtering, transforming, and governing data at the source—before it reaches your Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, or Datadog platforms.

This approach does three things: [point to pillars]

One: Reduces platform costs by 50 to 70 percent.

Two: Accelerates your engineering velocity—your teams build instead of firefight.

Three: Deploys AI-ready infrastructure—only clean, high-value data reaches your models.

Let me show you how."

[Pause, advance to Slide 2]

Slide 2: Problem Slide
Visual on screen:

Headline: "Your Platforms Are Drowning in Garbage"
Diagram: Sources → 100% Volume → Platforms with dollar signs
Large stat: "70% of ingested data is never queried"
Three bullets supporting
Script: "Here's the problem. [Point to diagram]

All your data—from edge devices, servers, applications, IoT sensors—flows directly into your cloud platforms. No filtering. No optimization. No control.

[Point to dollar signs] You pay at every stage. Ingestion costs. Storage costs. Compute costs. Egress costs.

[Point to large stat] And here's the kicker: 70 percent of the data sitting in your platforms is never queried. [Pause]

You're paying to move, store, and process terabytes you don't need.

[Point to bullets] Your bills are growing 40 percent year-over-year, but your insights aren't. And your engineering teams? They spend 40 percent of their time firefighting broken pipelines instead of building new capabilities.

[Pause]

So why does this happen?"

[Advance to Slide 3]

Slide 3: Root Cause Slide
Visual on screen:

Headline: "The Missing Layer"
Context text explaining old approach
Architecture diagram showing gap
Bottom statement about damage done
Script: "It's not because you made bad decisions. It's because the architecture that worked for 20 years no longer works today.

[Point to context text] For decades, best practice was simple: collect all your data, move it to a central location, and process it there.

When data volumes were measured in gigabytes, this worked. Today, with terabytes and petabytes distributed everywhere? It's bankrupting enterprises.

[Point to diagram - top] Here's your architecture: data flows from distributed sources...

[Point to middle - the gap] And here's the problem: there's NO CONTROL LAYER. [Pause]

No filtering. No optimization. No governance at the source. Everything just moves downstream.

[Point to bottom - platforms] By the time data lands in your platforms, you're paying for 100 percent of it—whether it's valuable or not.

[Point to bottom statement] The financial damage is done before you can optimize.

You can't solve this problem downstream. You have to solve it at the source."

[Advance to Slide 4]

Slide 4-6: Pillar Slides (Example: Pillar 1 - Cost)
Visual on screen:

Headline: "Reduce Platform Costs by 50-70%"
Large metric: "$1.77M saved annually"
Context: "Fortune 500 retail chain, 58% cost reduction"
Three bullets explaining how
Script: "So let's talk about cost. [Point to headline]

Expanso reduces platform costs by 50 to 70 percent.

[Point to metric] A Fortune 500 retail chain saved $1.77 million annually—a 58 percent cost reduction across Snowflake and Datadog.

[Point to bullets] Here's how:

First: We filter 50 to 70 percent of data volume at the source. Garbage never reaches your platforms.

Second: We reduce cloud egress costs by 88 percent. Data stays where it lives—you don't pay to move it.

Third: We lower storage costs from $83 per terabyte centralized to $35 per terabyte distributed.

This is cost control in action—not optimizing what you've already paid for, but preventing the cost in the first place.

[Pause]

And it's not just about cost."

[Advance to Slide 5 - Pillar 2]

Slide 10: Call to Action
Visual on screen:

Headline: "Start Cutting Costs in 90 Days"
CTA: "Schedule a cost analysis" with URL
Contact info
Script: "Here's what I'd like to do next.

[Point to CTA] Let's schedule a 30-minute cost analysis. We'll look at your current Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, and Datadog spend, show you exactly where the waste is, and calculate how much you could save with Expanso.

No obligation. No sales pitch. Just data.

Most customers see ROI in under 90 days.

[Point to contact] You can reach me directly at aronchick@expanso.io, or visit expanso.io to schedule.

[Pause]

You can keep paying the Data Tax on garbage you don't need, or you can start controlling your data at the source.

What questions do you have?"

FINAL REMINDERS
Before You Start Creating Slides:
Know your audience: Executive? Technical? Multi-persona?
Know your goal: Awareness? Consideration? Decision?
Know your time: 10 minutes? 20 minutes? 45 minutes?
Start with structure: Outline 10 slides before designing
One concept per slide: If you're explaining 2 things, make 2 slides
While Creating Slides:
Check font sizes: Nothing under 30pt for body, 19pt for footer
Check word repetition: Scan for repeated words on same slide
Check whitespace: Aim for 50-65% empty space
Check focal point: One element should dominate
Check contrast: White on navy = high contrast always
After Creating Slides:
Read aloud: Does it take 20 minutes or less?
Stand back: Can you read it from 20 feet away?
Show someone: Do they understand without your explanation?
Run the checklist: Content, design, accessibility, brand
Export and test: Does it look right on other devices?

Fewer words per slide (people are far away)
More visuals, less text
Bold, provocative headlines (grab attention)
Slower pace (people taking photos of slides)
TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
"My slide feels cluttered"
Solutions:

Remove 50% of the text - if you can say it, don't write it
Increase whitespace - add more margin around elements
Split into 2 slides - one concept per slide rule
Remove decorative elements - every element must serve the message
Increase font size - forces you to use fewer words
"My fonts look too small"
Solutions:

Check actual point size - must be 30pt minimum for body text
Reduce amount of text - don't try to fit paragraphs
Use hierarchy - not everything needs to be same size
Test from distance - stand 20 feet away, can you read it?
Remove the content - if it doesn't fit in 30pt, it doesn't belong
"I can't fit my message in the space"
Solutions:

Simplify the message - what's the ONE thing to remember?
Use speaker notes - detailed explanation goes in notes, not on slide
Split into multiple slides - better 2 clear slides than 1 cluttered
Use a diagram - visual can replace 100 words
Question if you need it - does this slide serve the narrative?
"The colors don't look right"
Solutions:

Check hex values - must match brand guidelines exactly
Check color profile - should be sRGB for screen
Check monitor calibration - colors may look different on different screens
Use color picker - sample from reference slides to ensure match
Export and test - view on multiple devices to verify
"The gradient has banding"
Solutions:

Increase bit depth - use 16-bit color if possible
Add noise texture - 3% opacity hides banding
Use more gradient stops - add intermediate color at 25% and 75%
Export at higher resolution - 2x or 3x native resolution
Use PNG instead of JPEG - lossless compression preserves gradients
"Fonts are rendering differently"
Solutions:

Embed fonts - ensure Inter is embedded in file
Check font installation - verify Inter is installed on system
Use web fonts - for web-based presentations, load from Google Fonts 4

. Outline fonts - convert text to outlines/paths for guaranteed rendering 5. Test on target platform - check how it looks where it will be presented

"Slide numbers/timing is off"
Solutions:

Remove appendix from count - only count main 10 slides
Practice with timer - use presenter mode with timer visible
Cut content - if over 20 minutes, remove slides or simplify
Add speaker notes - helps maintain pace without adding slide content
Budget 2 minutes per slide - rough guideline for pacing
"Animations aren't working"
Solutions:

Check platform support - not all platforms support all animation types
Simplify animations - use basic fade/move instead of complex effects
Test export format - animations may not work in PDF
Remove animations - for maximum compatibility, use static slides
Use fragments instead - platform-specific fragment syntax (Sli.dev, Reveal.js)
"Images are pixelated"
Solutions:

Use higher resolution - minimum 2x native resolution (3840×2160px)
Use vector formats - SVG for logos and diagrams
Don't upscale images - use original size or larger, never stretch small images
Export at higher DPI - 300 DPI minimum for crisp rendering
Use PNG not JPEG - for graphics with text or sharp edges
WORKFLOW & PROCESS
Step 1: Planning (Before Creating Slides)
Questions to answer:

Who is the audience? (Persona: CFO, Engineering, CDO, Multi-persona)
What is the goal? (Awareness, Consideration, Decision)
How much time? (5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 45 min)
What format? (Live, PDF, Video, Conference)
What's the one thing they should remember?
Outline the narrative:

What problem are we solving?
Why does it exist?
What's our solution?
How does it work?
What proof do we have?
What's the next step?
Create slide titles first:

Write headline for each slide
Ensure logical flow from one to next
Verify you're under 10 slides
Check that each slide has ONE concept
Step 2: Content Creation
For each slide:

Write the headline (60-72pt)
Identify the focal point (what should they look at?)
Add supporting text (30-36pt, 3-5 bullets max)
Consider if visual would help (diagram, chart, icon)
Write speaker notes (what will you say?)
Content checklist per slide:

 One concept only
 Headline is clear and specific
 Text is minimal (can read in 3 seconds)
 No word repetition on this slide
 Active verbs used
 Metrics are specific (not vague)
 Supports overall narrative
Step 3: Visual Design
For each slide:

Apply navy-to-charcoal gradient background
Set headline (left-aligned for most, centered for title slide)
Set body text (left-aligned, 30pt minimum)
Add visual element if needed (diagram, metric, icon)
Add footer if needed (presenter info, slide number)
Check whitespace (50-65%)
Check focal point (one element dominates)
Design checklist per slide:

 Background gradient applied
 Fonts are Inter family
 All body text 30pt or larger
 Colors match brand palette
 One focal point
 50-65% whitespace
 Readable from 20 feet
Step 4: Review & Refinement
Self-review:

Read through entire deck without stopping
Time yourself - under 20 minutes?
Stand back 20 feet - can you read everything?
Check for word repetition across slides
Verify all metrics are cited correctly
Run quality checklist (see earlier section)
Peer review:

Show to colleague who doesn't know the content
Ask: "What's the main message?"
Ask: "What's confusing?"
Ask: "What would you remove?"
Incorporate feedback selectively
Final polish:

Fix any typos or grammatical errors
Ensure consistent spacing/alignment
Verify all links work (if interactive)
Check export quality on target device
Save final version with clear filename
Step 5: Delivery Preparation
Practice:

Rehearse full presentation 3 times minimum
Time yourself each time - adjust pacing
Practice transitions between slides
Prepare for anticipated questions
Record yourself - watch for filler words, pacing issues
Technical setup:

Test on actual presentation equipment
Have backup (PDF, USB drive, cloud link)
Test screen mirroring/projection
Verify fonts render correctly
Check that animations work (if using)
Day of presentation:

Arrive early to test setup
Have water available (dry mouth during presenting)
Silence phone/notifications
Open presenter notes on second screen
Take deep breath, start confidently

- Restructured three pillars to avoid word repetition
- Reduced from 12 slides to 10 slides (10/20/30 rule)
A/B Testing Variations
Test different approaches:

Version A: Lead with cost problem (Pillar 1 first)
Version B: Lead with velocity problem (Pillar 2 first)
Version C: Lead with provocative headline ("Stop Moving Garbage Data")
Track results:

Which version gets more questions?
Which version leads to more follow-up meetings?
Which version resonates with which audiences?
Which metrics get the strongest reaction?
Iterate based on feedback:

If executives always ask about cost, lead with Pillar 1
If engineers focus on architecture, expand Slide 3 (root cause)
If AI leaders care most about quality, emphasize Pillar 3 earlier
If specific metric resonates, make it more prominent

FINAL NOTE
This framework is comprehensive, but don't let perfection block progress.

The most important rules:

10/20/30 rule - 10 slides, 20 minutes, 30pt fonts
One concept per slide - clarity over completeness
Specific metrics - "58% reduction" not "significant savings"
No word repetition - avoid fatigue on minimal slides
Whitespace - 50-65% empty space signals confidence
Start with these five rules. Everything else is refinement.

When in doubt, ask: "Does this serve the message, or am I just filling space?"

Good luck building your deck.
