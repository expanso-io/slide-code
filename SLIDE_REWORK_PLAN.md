# Slide Rework Plan: Systematic Brand Compliance

This document provides a step-by-step plan to rework all slides in `index.html` against the updated Expanso brand guidelines.

## Overview

**Objective**: Update all 8 slides (5 main + 3 appendix) to comply with brand guidelines from `LLM_EVERGREEN_PROMPT.md`

**Key Changes Required**:
1. **Language**: Replace "Upstream" with "at the source" or "where data lives"
2. **Typography**: Ensure all fonts ≥30pt (10/20/30 rule), headlines 60-96pt, metrics 96-144pt
3. **Whitespace**: Verify 60%+ whitespace on every slide
4. **Metrics**: Use specific numbers (50-70%, $1.77M, 58%, 88%, 16×, etc.) not vague claims
5. **Voice**: Active voice and strong verbs (Cut, Filter, Deploy, Control, Accelerate, Enable)
6. **Positioning**: No villain narratives—position as complementary to platforms
7. **Jargon**: Define technical terms immediately (e.g., "data gravity")
8. **Promises**: Focus on dramatic improvement (50-70%), not perfection
9. **Proof**: Every claim backed by metric or customer proof point
10. **Persona**: Each slide targets appropriate audience pain point

**Timeline**: ~1-2 hours for all 8 slides

**Presentation Context**: ___ Investor/Board ___ Technical/Customer ___ Sales ___ Conference

## Slide-by-Slide Checklist

### ✅ Slide 1: Title Slide
**Status**: Recently Updated (Oct 28) - Brand Compliant
**Title**: "Upstream Data Control"
**Audit Notes**:
- ✅ Uses brand-compliant navy gradient background
- ✅ Typography sizes correct (96pt tagline, 42pt value pillars)
- ✅ Footer contact info appropriate size (24pt, 21pt)
- ✅ Generous whitespace (~70%)
- ❌ **NEEDS FIX**: Title says "Upstream Data Control" - should be rephrased

**Action Items**:
- [  ] **Change headline** from "Upstream Data Control" to alternative:
  - Option A: "Data Control at the Source"
  - Option B: "Filter Data Where It Lives"
  - Option C: "Control Data Before the Cloud"
  - **User Decision**: _________________
- [  ] Test locally after change
- [  ] Verify with SLIDE_CHECKLIST.md

## Brand Voice Quick Reference

### ✅ ALWAYS Do:
- Say "at the source" or "where data lives"
- Use active verbs: Cut, Filter, Deploy, Control, Accelerate, Enable
- Name platforms: Snowflake, Databricks, Splunk, Datadog
- Show before/after contrast
- Provide proof immediately after claims
- Lead with measurable outcomes

### ❌ NEVER Do:
- Use "upstream" (too technical, requires explanation)
- Use vague claims ("innovative", "best-in-class", "next-generation")
- Create villain narratives (position as complementary)
- Promise perfection (focus on dramatic improvement)
- Use passive voice ("costs are reduced" → "Cut costs by 58%")
- Bury metrics ("significant" → "58%")

### Positioning Statements by Context:
- **Investor/Board**: "Filter Data at the Source"
- **Technical/Customer**: "Process Data Where It Lives"
- **Sales**: Three-pillar framework (Cost, Velocity, AI-ready)
- **Conference**: Bold/provocative (e.g., "Stop Moving Garbage Data")
